My	O

I	O

remembered	O
just	O
before	O

I	O
awoke	O
at	O
3AM	O
with	O
an	O
a	O
knee	B-ADR
that	O
was	O
just	O
throbbing	I-ADR
with	I-ADR

I	O
hobbled	O
to	O
the	O

took	O
a	O
dose	O
of	O
Advil	O

was	O

I	O
awoke	O
this	O

with	O
about	O
a	O

it	O
seems	O

subsided	O

the	O

I	O
will	O
never	O

I	O
may	O
cut	O
the	O

and	O
possibly	O
stop	O
altogether	O
if	O
the	O

at	O
an	O

About	O
a	O

diarrhea	B-ADR

This	O

many	O

However	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
any	O

should	O
make	O
it	O
abundantly	O
clear	O
to	O
the	O

that	O
very	O
serious	O
consequences	O
could	O
ensue	O
that	O
would	O
cause	O
extreme	B-ADR

could	O
effect	O
quality	O

.	O
	
I	O
believe	O
that	O
failure	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
is	O
a	O
serious	O
deriliction	O
of	O
duty	O
that	O
should	O

THIS	O

!!!!!!!.	O
	
I	O
was	O
put	O
on	O
this	O
drug	O
by	O
my	O
doctor	O
for	O
my	O
somewhat	O
high	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
after	O
starting	O
this	O
drug	O
,	O
I	O
suddenly	O
felt	B-ADR
like	I-ADR
I	I-ADR
had	I-ADR
aged	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
eighty	I-ADR
years	I-ADR
old	I-ADR
overnight	I-ADR
but	O
did	O
not	O
connect	O
it	O
to	O
starting	O
Lipitor	O
.	O
	
Up	O
until	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
this	O
drug	O
I	O
felt	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
as	O
young	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
my	O
twenties	O
and	O
wondered	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
how	O
you	O
might	O
start	O
feeling	O
the	O
affects	O
of	O
age	O
,	O
by	O
waking	O
up	O
one	O
morning	O
and	O
feeling	B-ADR
all	I-ADR
that	I-ADR
age	I-ADR
caught	I-ADR
up	I-ADR
with	I-ADR
you	I-ADR
and	O
now	O
you	O
were	O
older	O
than	O
your	O
years	O
.	O
	
I	O
took	O
the	O
drug	O
for	O
two	O
terrible	O
months	O
and	O
then	O
had	O
a	O
blood	O
test	O
and	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
had	O
dropped	O
.	O
	
My	O
doctor	O
mailed	O
me	O
the	O
results	O
of	O
my	O
blood	O
test	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
send	O
me	O
a	O
new	O
prescription	O
like	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
so	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
refilled	O
.	O
	
So	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
of	O
Lipitor	O
and	O
within	O
two	O
months	O
I	O
was	O
feeling	O
normal	O
again	O
and	O
even	O
took	O
a	O
job	O
with	O
the	O
post	O
office	O
where	O
I	O
walked	O
five	O
miles	O
a	O
day	O
with	O
no	O
problem	O
.	O
	
I	O
did	O
not	O
associate	O
my	O
getting	O
better	O
with	O
my	O
coming	O
off	O
Lipitor	O
,	O
unfortunately	O
.	O
	
Then	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
appointment	O
with	O
my	O
doctor	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
refilled	O
that	O
prescription	O
by	O
calling	O
his	O
office	O
.	O
	
So	O
I	O
did	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
after	O
taking	O
only	O
one	O
pill	O
,	O
I	B-ADR
was	I-ADR
eighty	I-ADR
years	I-ADR
old	I-ADR
again	O
.	O
	
This	O
time	O
I	O
did	O
associate	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
Lipitor	O
and	O
then	O
read	O
the	O
warnings	O
the	O
drug	O
store	O
gives	O
you	O
with	O
meds	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
my	O
symptoms	O
were	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
what	O
they	O
warned	O
against	O
.	O
	
I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
hypochondriac	O
and	O
I	O
never	O
read	O
those	O
warnings	O
so	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
head	O
thing	O
.	O
	
I	O
immediately	O
went	O
off	O
the	O
drug	O
but	O
a	O
year	O
later	O
I	O
am	O
still	O
have	O
the	O
same	O
eighty	B-ADR
years	I-ADR
old	I-ADR
feeling	I-ADR
and	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
I	O
will	O
ever	O
be	O
normal	O
again	O
.	O
	
I	O
do	O
not	O
understand	O
how	O
just	O
one	O
pill	O
can	O
do	O
that	O
and	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
recovering	O
like	O
I	O
did	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
.	O
	
This	O
has	O
ruined	O
my	O
life	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
never	O
have	O
taken	O
Lipitor	O
if	O
I	O
knew	O
what	O
I	O
know	O
now	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
so	O
sorry	O
that	O
I	O
ever	O
heard	O
of	O
this	O
drug	O
.	O
	
This	O
is	O
so	O
severe	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
even	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
can	O
cause	O
permanent	O
damage	O

My	O
doctor	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
of	O
all	O
this	O
,	O
wanted	O
to	O
change	O
statins	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
still	O
worried	O
about	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
.	O
	
I	O
told	O
him	O
no	O
more	O
statins	O
and	O
he	O
then	O
prescribed	O
Zetia	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
said	O
was	O
was	O
less	O
effective	O
but	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
statin	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
am	O
still	O
afraid	O
to	O
take	O
unless	O
I	O
improve	O
from	O
the	O
affects	O
of	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
.	O
	
He	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
was	O
on	O
Lipitor	O
himself	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
problems	O
but	O
then	O
said	O
,	O
well	O
he	O
did	O
have	O
neck	O
pains	O
that	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
side	O
affect	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
the	O
drug	O
two	O
years	O
before	O
this	O
developed	O
.	O
	
I	O
told	O
him	O
of	O
the	O
information	O
on	O
this	O
site	O
that	O
describes	O
some	O
people	O
having	O
that	O
delayed	O
reaction	O
and	O
I	O
advised	O
him	O
to	O
take	O
himself	O
off	O
of	O
this	O
drug	O
for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
weeks	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
the	O
neck	O

cleared	O
up	O

I	O

DO	O
NOT	O

THIS	O
DRUG	O
!!!!!.	O
	
sudden	O
onset	O
severe	B-ADR
depression	I-ADR
.	O
	
It	O
worked	O
very	O
well	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
it	O
was	O
prescribed	O
and	O
I	O
lost	O
20	O
pounds	O
using	O
it	O
with	O
exercise	O
and	O
diet	O
.	O
	
When	O
this	O
medication	O
was	O
combined	O
with	O
a	O
SSRI	O
it	O
failed	O
to	O
reduce	O
my	O
HDL	O
cholesterol	O
in	O
a	O
meaningful	O
amount	O
and	O
it	O
caused	O
intense	B-ADR
anxiety	I-ADR
attacks	I-ADR
and	O
short	O
periods	O
of	O
intense	B-ADR
depression	I-ADR
.	O
	
If	O
I	O
take	O
the	O
pill	O
on	O
an	O
empty	O
stomach	O
I	O
get	O
a	O

almost	O
to	O

I	O
also	O
get	O

are	O
no	O
gas	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
and	O
no	O

,	O
so	O
it	O
'	O
s	O
inconvenient	O
more	O

anything	O

When	O
